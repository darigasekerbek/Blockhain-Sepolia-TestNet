## Smart Contract Deployment
The contract was compiled, generating the Application Binary Interface (ABI) and bytecode, which were stored in Demo.json. Deployment was executed through a dedicated script in Deploy.js, ensuring a smooth and automated process.

## Smart Contract Interaction
Following deployment, contract functions were executed by signing and broadcasting transactions via Call.js. This script manages transaction signing, submission to the Ethereum network, and interaction with the deployed contract, showcasing a complete blockchain workflow.
